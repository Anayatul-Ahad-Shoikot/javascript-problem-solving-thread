What I have learned from this problem:

1.  split()-    This method takes 2 argument separator & limit,
                works only for string,
                returns a new array, 
                do not change the original string,
                based on separator it split the string. 

2.  map()-      This method has a callback function inside it,
                iterate over each item of an iterable datatype,
                then can do operation of each item of an iterable.

3.  trim()-     this method is a string method,
                removes header and trailer white spaces


4.  replace()-  String method,
                replace anything from string as given argument

5.  reverse()-  This is an array method,
                reverse the array.
